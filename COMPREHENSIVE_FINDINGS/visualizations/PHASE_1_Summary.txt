PHASE 1 KEY FINDINGS
    
    ✓ BEST MODEL: Lasso (62.9% avg) - Won 6/14 assets
    ✓ MOST CONSISTENT: Ridge (low variance)
    ✓ BEST ASSET TYPE: Credit (61.2% avg)
    ✓ HIGHEST HIT RATE: SRLN 86.7% (multiple models)
    ✓ ABOVE RANDOM: 95% of tests beat 50%
    
    CRITICAL INSIGHT:
    Credit assets (SRLN, BKLN) show 80-87% hit rates,
    suggesting strong mechanical linkage between macro
    indicators and private credit returns.
    
    Simple regularized models (Ridge, Lasso) outperform
    complex ML in static testing - feature selection
    matters more than model complexity.
