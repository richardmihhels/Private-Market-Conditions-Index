PHASE 3 KEY FINDINGS - WHY BINARY TIMING FAILED
    
    ❌ THE SHOCKING RESULT:
    
    Hit Rate: 64.6%
    Strategy Return: +35.5%
    Buy & Hold Return: +53.5%
    Underperformance: -18.0%
    
    Despite predicting direction correctly 65% of time,
    binary LONG/CASH strategy LOST by 18.0%!
    
    ❌ ROOT CAUSES:
    
    1. OPPORTUNITY COST (Main Killer)
       - In cash 25.7% of time (29 months)
       - Missed ~14.5% cumulative gains
       - SRLN has positive drift (+4.7% annual)
    
    2. UNEQUAL IMPACT
       - False negatives (missed gains): 18 months
       - False positives (took losses): 22 months
       - Missing gains > avoiding losses
    
    3. WRONG IMPLEMENTATION
       - Binary (100% or 0%) too aggressive
       - Doesn't respect positive drift
       - Need 75%+ hit rate to overcome opportunity cost
    
    💡 CRITICAL INSIGHT:
    
    Implementation matters MORE than accuracy!
    
    Implementation design matters:
    - Binary timing (0-100%): Underperforms vs buy-hold
    - Better position sizing: Can improve outcomes
    
    Strategy design is critical for profitability!
    
    ✓ LESSON: Don't fight the drift, embrace it
       Stay invested, vary exposure instead
