INTERPRETATION GUIDE
==========================================================================================

• Positive difference = Factor matters MORE in good times
• Negative difference = Factor matters MORE in bad times (crisis predictor)
• Small difference = Relationship is STABLE across regimes

Use this to understand which indicators are:
  - Pro-cyclical boosters (work best when times are good)
  - Crisis indicators (become important when markets turn)
  - All-weather indicators (consistent across both regimes)
