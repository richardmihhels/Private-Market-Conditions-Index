📖 INTERPRETATION GUIDE
==========================================================================================

COEFFICIENT: The slope of the regression line
  • Positive = Factor increase → Returns increase
  • Negative = Factor increase → Returns decrease
  • Magnitude = Size of effect (in percentage points)

R-SQUARED: How much variation is explained
  • 0.10 = Explains 10% of returns (weak)
  • 0.25 = Explains 25% of returns (moderate)
  • 0.50 = Explains 50% of returns (strong)

P-VALUE: Statistical significance
  • < 0.01 = Highly significant (*** very reliable)
  • < 0.05 = Significant (** reliable)
  • > 0.05 = Not significant (* might be noise)

STANDARD DEVIATION (std dev):
  • Features are z-scored (normalized)
  • 1 std dev = typical monthly fluctuation
  • 2 std dev = large monthly move

🎓 EXAMPLE INTERPRETATION
==========================================================================================

If we see: 'Blackstone ~ HY Spreads, Coefficient = -0.035'

This means:
  1. When HY spreads tighten by 1 std dev (improving credit conditions)
  2. Blackstone returns increase by 3.5%
  3. This is because the spreads variable was inverted (⬇)

Real-world example:
  • Normal month: HY spread change = 0
  • Good month: HY spreads tighten by 50bp (1 std dev)
  • Result: BX returns 3.5% higher than expected!
